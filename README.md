**CSV to Parquet Conversion using Python**

This repository contains a simple Python script to convert CSV files into Apache Parquet format. The goal is to demonstrate how Parquet can be used for efficient data storage and fast data retrieval.

**About the Project**

CSV files are easy to use but are not optimized for large-scale data processing. Apache Parquet is a column-oriented, compressed file format that provides better performance and reduced storage size. This project shows how to convert a CSV file into Parquet using Python.

**Requirements**

Python 3.8+

pandas

pyarrow

fastparquet

Install dependencies using:

_**pip install pandas pyarrow fastparquet**__


**Benefits of Using Parquet**

Smaller file size due to compression

Faster read performance

Efficient for analytics and machine learning workloads

Industry standard format for big data processing

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates a simple and effective way to convert CSV files into Parquet format using Python, enabling better performance, scalability, and efficient data handling.
