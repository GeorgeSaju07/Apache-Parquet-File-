It provides efficent data compression and encoding schemes with enhanced performance to handle complex data in bulk. Parquet is available in multiple languages including Java, C++, Python etc..\n","\n","### **What does it mean Column-Oriented?**\n","\n","This means that data is stored by column by column instead of row by row.\n","\n","***Example:***\n","\n","ID     → [1, 2, 3]\n","\n","Name   → [John, Anna, Peter]\n","\n","Age    → [30, 28, 35]\n","\n","Salary → [50000, 60000, 70000]\n","\n","### **Characteristics:**\n","\n","\n","*   Excellent for analysis(OLAP)\n","*   Extremely fast for aggregations and filters\n","*  High compression efficency\n","\n","### **What Does “Efficient Data Storage and Retrieval” Mean?**\n","\n","It means that storing data using minimum space and retrieving only the required data in the fastest possible time.\n","\n","* **Efficient Storage** → Less disk, less memory, less cost.\n","\n","* **Efficient Retrieval** → Faster reading, lower latency, higher performance\n","\n","\n","***Storage Comparison***\n","\n","Format\tFile Size\n","\n","***CSV*** :\t1

designed to optimize both data storage and retrieval, making it ideal for large-scale analytics and data science workflows. By storing data column-wise, applying advanced compression techniques, and enabling selective column reading, Parquet significantly reduces file size and improves query performance compared to traditional row-based formats like CSV and Excel. Converting CSV files into Parquet using Python not only saves storage space but also accelerates data processing, analytics, and machine learning pipelines. As a result, Parquet has become the industry standard for big data processing, cloud data lakes, and high-performance analytical systems."],"metadata":{"id":"8t0AdVWtMt2Z"}}]}
